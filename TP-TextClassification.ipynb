    "As we have seen in the [second practical session](https://coling.epfl.ch/TP/TP-eval.php), a great example of a highly-biased task is **spam classification**. The goal of the task is to classify whether a given piece of text (e.g., email, sms message) is spam or not. Since there are only 2 classes (spam or not), we call such tasks **binary classification**. However, text classification tasks can also include **multi-label tasks** such as **news article topic prediction**. Following these two tasks, this practical session has 3 sections:\n",

If you'd like to, here is a [quick tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D8TapyWrfyWijfrGq5BtYfrAoWmSmgcP-Gx3i2MXWvo/edit) on virtual environments that you can checkout with an EPFL email. \n",

First make sure you have (a virtual environment (e.g., [venv, virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)), and that the environment has) a Python version >= 3.6, per [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [torch](https://pytorch.org/) requirements.
